### Automated speech keyword detection with 1D and 2D CNNs

This project sought to classify 1-second of audio into one of 11 different categories. Two different model setups were explored - feeding 1-second raw waveforms to a 1-Dimensional ConvNet, vs. transforming raw waveform to a frequency representation and extracting 2D features by using Mel-Frequency Capstrum Coefficients (MFCC), which were then fed into a 2D ConvNet.

### Inventory tracker

Used Python, AWS, and RShiny to track inventory for a small business. Wrote Python script to extract data from the businessâ€™s website through Shopify REST APIs, then set up cron jobs to automate daily. Then used a cloud database

### Bayesian Model Selection for Ising Graphical Models

Exploring applications of Bayesian inference to the Ising model. Extends the Decoupling Shrinkage and Selection Loss (Hahn and Carvalho, 2015) to Ising models. In order to calculate the DSS Loss, the psuedolikelihood is used to address the intractability of likelihood calculations with the Ising normalizing constant.
